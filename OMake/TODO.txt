TODO:


1. Allow the inclusion of other OMake files.

2. Allow platform-specific source defines.

3. Allow the defining of functions and the 
   generation of files, such as headers, for
   use in configuring the actual source code
   in a cross platform build.
   
4. Create a standard library of functions and
   platform aliases for inclusion. Try to do
   this in a way that allows them to be directly
   included in the OMake exe, as well as be 
   able to load them from the filesystem.
   
5. Allow for Async statements.
   
6. Need to see if there is a way to speed up
   the caching that the WildcardEvaluator does.
